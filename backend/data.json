        "prompt": "What is atrial fibrillation (AFib)?",
        "completion": "Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is a common type of arrhythmia where the heart's upper chambers (atria) beat irregularly and often faster than normal. It can increase the risk of stroke and other complications. Treatment options for AFib include medications, catheter ablation, or electrical cardioversion. Lifestyle tips to manage AFib include reducing caffeine and alcohol intake, managing stress, and maintaining a heart-healthy diet."

      {
        "prompt": "What is ventricular tachycardia (VT)?",
        "completion": "Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is a serious arrhythmia that originates in the heart's lower chambers (ventricles). It causes a rapid and potentially life-threatening heartbeat. Treatment options for VT may include antiarrhythmic medications, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), or catheter ablation. Avoiding triggers like excessive alcohol or stimulant intake and taking medications as prescribed can help manage VT."

      {
        "prompt": "What is bradycardia?",
        "completion": "Bradycardia is a condition characterized by a slow heart rate, usually below 60 beats per minute. While it can be normal in some people, severe bradycardia may cause dizziness, fatigue, or fainting. Treatment options for bradycardia may include a pacemaker to help regulate the heart's rhythm. Regular exercise, a balanced diet, and avoiding excessive use of certain medications can also be beneficial for managing bradycardia."
